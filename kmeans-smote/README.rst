Abstract
========

Learning from class-imbalanced data continues to be a common and challenging
problem in supervised learning as standard classification algorithms are
designed to handle balanced class distributions. While different strategies
exist to tackle this problem, methods which generate artificial data to achieve
a balanced class distribution are more versatile than modifications to the
classification algorithm. Such techniques, called oversamplers, modify the
training data, allowing any classifier to the proposed method improves
classification results. Moreover, k-means SMOTE consistently outperforms other
popular oversampling methods. An implementation is made available in the Python
programming language.
