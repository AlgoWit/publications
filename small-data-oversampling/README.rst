Abstract
========

In the age of the data deluge there are still many domains and applications
restricted to the use of small datasets. The ability to harness these small
datasets to solve problems through the use of supervised learning methods can
have a significant impact in many important areas. The insufficient size of data
sets usually results in unsatisfactory performance of machine learning
algorithms. The current research work aims to contribute to mitigate the small
dataset problem through the creation of artificial instances, which are added to
the training process. The over-sampling algorithm Geometric SMOTE is applied to
generate new instances and enhance the initial dataset. Experimental results
show a significant improvement in accuracy when compared with the use of the
original small dataset and also over other over-sampling techniques such as
Random Over-sampling, SMOTE and Borderline SMOTE. These findings show that
over-sampling research, developed in the context of imbalanced learning, can
also be a valid option to improve accuracy in small data problems.
