Abstract
========

In the age of the data deluge there are still many domains and applications
restricted to the use of small datasets. The ability to harness these small
datasets to solve problems through the use of supervised learning methods can
have a significant impact in many important areas. The insufficient size of
training data usually results in unsatisfactory performance of machine learning
algorithms. The current research work aims to contribute to mitigate the small
data problem through the creation of artificial instances, which are added to
the training process. The proposed algorithm Geometric SMOTE for Small Data
utilizes the Geometric SMOTE data generation mechanism to generate new high
quality instances. Experimental results present a significant improvement in
accuracy when compared with the use of the initial small dataset and also over
other oversampling techniques such as Random OverSampling, SMOTE and
Borderline SMOTE. These findings show that oversampling research, developed
in the context of imbalanced learning, can also be a valid option to deal
with the small data problem.
